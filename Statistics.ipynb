To use election polls as an example, the population is all the people in the country, whereas a sample is a subset of the population that the statisticians measure. The great thing about statistics is that by only measuring (in this case by doing a phone survey or similar) a sample of the population, you can work out what is most likely to be the measurement if you used the entire population. In this statistics section, I am going to assume that our data sets are samples of some bigger population.
